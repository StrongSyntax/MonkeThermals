# MonkeThermals
A Gorilla Tag Utility that improves the gliding experience for players, with two modes for players looking to speed through clouds, or players looking to improve bugs and access more freedom.

## Vanilla (Mode):

Vanilla mode is aimed at players looking to fix "bugs" or annoyances regarding the new gliders in the clouds map. As some of you may know, when using OVR, or SteamVR, and experiencing low(er) frame rates, the effect in which the air streams have on your glider is weakened.

MonkeThermals has a feature to automatically adjust the strength to mitigate this effect.

## Invasive (Mode):
